            We find ourselves at a critical crossroads in the history of our
            species. With over 8 Billion of us on this planet and existential
            challenges (Climate, AI) of our own making looming over us, how we
            act going forward makes all the difference. Radical advances in
            technology and tools of coordination has ensured a fairly decent
            material standard of living relative to our past but has also
            dramatically amplified our power/influence on this planet as the
            keystone species and as the saying goes with great power comes
            great... Our detrimental presence on the climate / environment is an
            undeniable fact now and with EARTH being the only floating rock that
            has the serendipitous capacity to house LIFE, the question arises -{" "}
            <span className='text-[#1D2939]'>WTF are we doing!?</span>

            It is our belief that everyone reading this has asked this Question
            at some point in time. We are all here because there is some deep
            dissatisfaction and discomfort in the direction we are heading . We
            are currently inhabiting an economic framework that rewards
            externalizing negativities, promotes short term thinking, where
            doing the right thing usually means compromising on material gains,
            needs perpetual growth to survive and where optimizing for financial
            capital is the north star. This experiment of neoliberal capitalism
            has played itself out and it will only exacerbate the meta crisis if
            we empower it further. In retrospect we surely don&apos;t want to be{" "}

            So what now ? Well as our beloved advisor loves to say - One cannot
            solve a problem from the same frequency that created it. The
            socio-economic frequency we inhabit is simply a function of the
            story we tell ourselves manifesting itself via incentives for
            complex coordinated action leveraging the technologies we have today
            and fueled by one of the best know technologies of our time - MONEY.
            Thanks to Bitcoin we are{" "}

              experiencing a regenaissance in the frequencies programmable MONEY

            Today we can design our own monetary system on a permissionless,
            transparent, immutable, borderless ledger. Ascribe value to what we
            think is important, decide what kind of backing we want powering our
            monetary systems, incentivize aligned economic activity, subsidize
            critical elements, reward required actions, coordinate globally with
            complete sovereignty and without any intermediaries.

            We no longer have an excuse to blame any external agencies. Today we
            have the tools to take matters into our hands and create the
            regen/solarpunk reality we know is possible deep within.

              Transformation from where we are to where we want to be is
              probably one of the biggest, most radical transformations ever
              undertaken on this planet.{" "}
            </span>
            We essentially want to go from a reality where every single action
            we undertake has direct negative consequences on this biosphere to
            one where every action directly regenerates our biosphere. A reality
            where our energy only comes from clean sources, food from healthy
            soil, our homes regenerate us and our surroundings, our transport
            doesn&apos;t choke our lungs, natural ecosystems and its
            biodiversity is perceived as the only scarce resource in this solar
            system, businesses are regenerative by design, well being is the
            north star, AGI helps us focus on becoming more human...

            This definitely is an unprecedented challenge but humanity&apos;s
            past is replete with instances where a committed collective of
